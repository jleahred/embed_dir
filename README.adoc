= Embed-dir for Rust

crate.io package... https://crates.io/crates/embed_dir


You have the great macro `include_bytes!` in Rust

But sometimes is not enough. You could need to embed several files, generally in a folder.

In order to automate it, this simple and small tool generates code for you.

[NOTE]
Perhaps in the future this tool could be integrated on compilation process running `build`


== Running the tool

If you run the program without params or incorrect params number

----
    Simple program to generate code to embed files recursivily from a chosen folder.

    It will generate a source file with code to embed the files on folder.

    More info:  https://github.com/jleahred/embed_dir

    Usage:
        embed_dir  <origin-folder>  <destiny-file>

    where:
        origin-folder   string is the path to the folder containing the files to embed
        destiny-file    string is output filename (without .rs extension)


    example:

        embed_dir src/public src/embed.rs
----

=== Example on own project directory
----
cargo run test_folder src/test/pr.rs
----

== Generated code

This will generate a file per directory as:

[source, rust]
----
//  autogenerated  embed_dir  on ...


macro_rules! gen_get_includes_bytes{
    ($rel_path:expr, $($file:expr),+) => {
        pub fn get(file_name: &str) -> Option<&'static [u8]> {
            match file_name {
                $(
                    $file => Some(include_bytes!(concat!($rel_path, $file))),
                )+
                _ => None,
            }
        }
    }
}


gen_get_includes_bytes!("../../test_folder",
          "README.adoc",
          "Cargo.toml",
          "pr/README.adoc"
);
----


The first string on `gen_get_includes_bytes!` indicates the relative position to files from generated source file.

[source, rust]
----
"../../http_static/",
----

Next strings are the files (they can be nested on folders) included.


== Using the code


Quite simple and direct, just call get on the created module with the file name.

[source, rust]
----
    match super::http_static2::get("index.html") {
        Some(content) => content,
        None => &[] as &'static [u8],
    }
